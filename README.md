>**Basu, Karna, and Jonathan H. Conning. 2020.** “Commitment Costs: Present-Bias, Consumer Protection, and Firm Ownership Forms.”

>**ABSTRACT:** Hyperbolic discounters value consumption-smoothing commitment contracts but fear these might be renegotiated by future selves and banks, generating a consumer protection problem even for sophisticated and informed consumers that may distort equilibrium contracts and behavior (e.g. excess net borrowing). Then it may be to banks' advantage to offer consumer protection via regulation or costly governance/ownership choices to limit renegotiation profits capture. Our framework establishes new behavioral microfoundations for commercial non-profits, explains patterns of contracts, ownership forms and market structure in consumer banking and microfinance, and informs policy debates over terms such as \textquotedbl{}overindebtedness\textquotedbl{} and \textquotedbl{}excessive refinancing\textquotedbl{} in these sectors.
